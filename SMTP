Set Up the Environment:

    Install Metasploitable v2: Deploy the Metasploitable v2 virtual machine, which is intentionally designed with vulnerabilities for testing and educational purposes.
    Install Kali Linux: Use Kali Linux as the attacking machine, equipped with various penetration testing tools.

Identify Open Ports:

    Use Nmap for Scanning:
        Open a terminal in Kali Linux.
        Execute the command: nmap -sV [Target IP]
            -sV: Detects service versions.
        Review the scan results to identify open ports and services. Look for port 25, which is commonly used for SMTP.

Enumerate SMTP Service:

    Connect via Netcat:
        In the terminal, type: nc [Target IP] 25
        Observe the SMTP banner to gather information about the service.
    Use Telnet for Interaction:
        Enter: telnet [Target IP] 25
        After connecting, type HELP to list available SMTP commands.
        Note any additional information provided by the server.

Exploit SMTP for User Enumeration:

    Utilize Metasploit Framework:
        Launch Metasploit by typing msfconsole in the terminal.
        Search for relevant SMTP auxiliary modules:
            search smtp
        Select the appropriate module for user enumeration:
            use auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum
        Configure the module:
            set RHOSTS [Target IP]
            set USER_FILE /path/to/userlist.txt (a list of potential usernames)
        Execute the module:
            run
        Analyze the output to identify valid usernames.

Attempt to Retrieve Passwords:

    SMTP VRFY Command:
        While connected via Telnet or Netcat, use the VRFY command to verify user existence:
            VRFY username
        A positive response indicates the user exists.
    Brute-Force Attack:
        Employ tools like Hydra to perform a brute-force attack using the obtained usernames:
            hydra -l [username] -P /path/to/passwordlist.txt smtp://[Target IP] -V
        Monitor the output for successful login attempts.
